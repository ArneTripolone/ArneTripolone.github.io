# Code Refactor Exercise

## Description:
- A fictional company (Horiseon Social Solution Services) had a website which required refactoring to improve its accessibility.
- There were several div elements that needed changing into semantic html - ie, section, aside and nav.
- The accompanying css file was disorganised and provided no commentary on what elements were being targeted.
- After cleaning up both the html and css files, the website functions the same, but now with improved accessibility.
